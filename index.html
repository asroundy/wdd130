            <P>
                Hello! My name is Autumn Roundy and I am from New Mexico. I grew up in southern New Mexico where 
                green chili was our staple food item. I loved living the the southwest, but moved up north to 
                Meridian, ID after venturing through some of my college career. I have my associate's degree
                in photographic communications where I photographed wildlife in Yellowstone National Park for a year. 
                I am currently living this summer in Ketchikan, AK where I help run tour boats to private island
                trails in the Tongass National Forest. I continue photographing the wildlife here in Alaska and go
                on many excursions in my off time. I am so thrilled to be in Web Development and plan on making
                a long term career in this industy.
         </P>
